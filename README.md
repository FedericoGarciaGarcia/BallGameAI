# Ball Game AI [WORK IN PROGRESS]

A Neural Network + Genetic Algorithm will be used to train a simple ball game AI.

# Game Description

[![Gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FedericoGarciaGarcia/BallGameAI/master/Resources/gameplay.gif)

* The game consists of two players and a ball in a room.
* The user can control both players, only one at a time.
* The active player can be moved to the left and right.
* The players and ball cannot go outside the room.
* When the ball is in contact with the active player, the user can press the space bar to push the ball. After that, the active player becomes inactive and the other player becomes active.
* Every second that passes grants 10 points.
* The game ends when the ball touches the floor.
